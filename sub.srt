everyone back with a snap of a finger

00:00:16.48 --> 00:00:20.560
the sudden return of the population

7
00:00:20.88 --> 00:00:26.700
provided the necessary energy

8
00:00:23.92 --> 00:00:29.780

we were instructed not to interfere in

22
00:01:07.76 --> 00:01:10.720
any human conflicts unless deviants are
